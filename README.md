## Running Without Node.js

If you don't want to use Node.js, you can also open `index.html` directly in your browser. However, you'll need to:
1. Ensure your Venice AI API key supports CORS from local file origins
2. Or use a local web server like Python's SimpleHTTPServer

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 3000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: Make sure your Venice AI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- **No Results**: Check browser console for errors, ensure API key is saved
- **CORS Errors**: Use the Node.js server method instead of opening the file directly
