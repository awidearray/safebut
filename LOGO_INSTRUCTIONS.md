# Logo Instructions

## IMPORTANT: Add Your Logo PNG File

Please save your logo PNG image as `logo.png` in the root directory of this project.

The application is now configured to use `logo.png` with the following sizes:
- Navigation bar: 45x45px
- App header: 50x50px  
- Login/signup pages: 90x90px
- Policy/terms pages: 70x70px
- Safety database page: 90x90px

The PNG file will be automatically served at `/logo.png` and used as:
1. Favicon for all pages
2. Logo in navigation bars
3. Logo in headers and login screens

Once you add the `logo.png` file, the logo will appear everywhere in the application.
