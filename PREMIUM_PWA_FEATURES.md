# Progressive Web App (PWA) - Premium Feature Only

The PWA features for Safe Maternity are now configured as **premium-only benefits**. Free users will not have access to offline functionality or app installation features.

## 🎯 Premium-Only PWA Features

### What Premium Users Get:
1. **📱 Add to Home Screen** - Install the app on their phone/desktop
2. **🔌 Offline Access** - Use the app without internet connection
3. **🚀 Faster Loading** - Cached resources for instant access
4. **📲 App-Like Experience** - Full-screen mode without browser UI
5. **🔖 Smart Bookmarking** - Desktop bookmark reminders

### What Free Users Get:
- Standard website experience
- No offline functionality
- No install prompts
- No service worker caching
- Basic browser bookmarking only

## 🔧 How It Works

### Premium Detection
The system checks `localStorage.getItem('isPremium') === 'true'` to determine if a user has premium access.

### Key Files Modified:

1. **`pwa-installer.js`** - Now includes premium checks:
   - `isPremiumUser()` function checks premium status
   - Service worker only registers for premium users
   - Install prompts only show to premium users
   - Bookmark reminders only for premium users

2. **HTML Pages**:
   - `app.html` - Main app (keeps PWA features for premium users)
   - Other pages (index, login, etc.) - PWA features removed

3. **`upgrade.html`** - Added PWA features to the benefits list:
   - "Install as app on your phone (PWA)"
   - "Works offline - no internet needed"

## 📊 User Experience Flow

### Free User:
1. Uses the website normally
2. No PWA prompts or features
3. Sees PWA benefits on upgrade page
4. Must upgrade to get PWA features

### Premium User:
1. After upgrading, PWA features activate
2. Sees install prompt after 3 seconds
3. Can install app to home screen
4. Service worker caches content
5. App works offline

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- Premium status is checked client-side via localStorage
- Service worker registration is conditional on premium status
- No sensitive data is cached for non-premium users
- PWA manifest only loads for premium users

## 💡 Benefits of Premium-Only PWA

1. **Increased Conversions** - PWA features become a selling point
2. **Better User Segmentation** - Clear value proposition for premium
3. **Resource Management** - Reduced server load from free users
4. **Enhanced Premium Experience** - Exclusive features for paying users

## 🚀 Marketing Points

You can now advertise these PWA features as premium benefits:

- "Lightning-fast loading for premium members"
- "One-tap access from your home screen"
